*YOUR COMMUNITY HUB NEEDS YOU – NOW!*

The developer of Ashley Gardens next door to the Living Onder One Sun (LUOS) Community Hub is still trying to put in a gate to completely open up our safe, outdoor space, and to be a 'back garden' for residents of the new homes, *meaning the end of our much used, safe, enclosed & welcoming community space!*

This is before the Council and the Community have 'co-designed' the improvements planned for Down Lane Park & *swapping a much loved community space for a developer destination*. *It's too early to make this decision before the park plan is even agreed*.

We know the community values this safe and welcoming space. LUOS has objected to this proposal.

*HOW CAN I HELP?*

If you want to keep your Community Hub, Café, Growing Space and Gardens please *object to the gate in the planning application by Friday 1st April*. You can do this by:

*1. Registering and objection*
Go to bit.ly/luos-obj-plan, click on "Inform the Authority that you *object* to the Planning Application" and add some comments if you like. Here is an example you can use: bit.ly/luos-comments

*2. Contacting the planning officer**
Send an email objecting to application *HGY/2022/0656 Ashley Gardens* to the planning officer whose email is Philip.Elliott@haringey.gov.uk
