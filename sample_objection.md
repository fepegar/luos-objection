We think the LUOS Hub, Caf√© and Gardens are a very welcoming and really well used. The outdoor space, the gardens growing area and the open space are brilliant and an unusual asset.

We are objecting to the gate in this planning application because it would threaten the much needed work the community hub is doing.

As neighbours and park users we have found out about the exciting plans to improve the park and we think this application should be delayed until these plans are agreed - it is too early to decide.
